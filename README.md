#Setting up a Spark Cluster on Openstack

This repository gathers different investigation for cluster deployment in Openstack, including Spark Cluster, Kubernetes, and simple node deloyment using Fabric and Docker containers. This is still under active development.

There are two main parts for this repo:

1)  Setting up a cluster manually using Nova client/Fabric/Docker. See [here](ManualClusterSetup) for documentation.  

2)  Setting up a cluster using Kubernetes. See [here](KubernetesCluster) for details and documentation.
